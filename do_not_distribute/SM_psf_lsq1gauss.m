% function [xyDet,sigma]=SM_psf_lsq1gauss(t,xyzEm,opt)
%
% Explicit PSF using a least-squares fit of a single Gaussian to images of
% 40 nm beads, taken at 561 nm with Andor Ixon Ultra (Elf lab experiment
% EXP-14-BH0518).
%
% The model is the Gaussian standard deviation as a function of z, fitted
% in the approximate range ~[-1250 , 375]  nm. sig ~< 600 nm in this range
% (for 561 nm wavelength), and the minimum sigma is for z=0. z values
% outside this range are changed to the closest value inside the range, and
% a warning is issued. For wavelengths other than 561 nm, the std deviation
% is rescaled as sig(z,L)= L/561nm*sigma(z,561nm), but the z-dependence is
% not rescaled.
%
% NOTE: the PSF-width depends strongly and asymmetrically on z, and so it
% is provbably good to have more sample volume below the focal plane (z=0)
% than above it. A plot of sigma vs z should give some guidance in how to
% place the focal plane.
%
% output:
% xyDet     - positions of detected photons on the camera chip, randomly
%             generated using the PSF model.
% sigma     - PSF model std for every emitted photon, which depends on the
%             simulated wave-length and z-positions in xyzEm(:,3). This
%             output is useful for checking the output. 
% input:
% t         - photon emision times (one per photon, not used here)
% xyzEM     - positions of photon emitters, one xyz triplet per row for
%             each emitted per photon.
% opt       - PSF options
% opt.lambda- light wavelength in simulation (L in the above equation)
% 
%
% The options object opt here corresponds to the opt.psf structure defined
% in the Palantir runinput file. Calling SM_psf_lsq1gauss() with no
% parameters returns an options object with default parameters.
