% function I=SM_activationIntensity_uniform(opt)
%
% generate a basal intensity (photons/time unit) for a single fluorophore,
% based on the fields in the opt structure, which is the .baseIntensity field
% in the runinput file. Thismodel returns the same intensity opt.itensity
% every time.
%
% input     : option struct opt, with field opt.intensity
% output    : I=opt.intensity. If no input parameters are given, a default
%             opt struct is returned, with intensity=1e5;
