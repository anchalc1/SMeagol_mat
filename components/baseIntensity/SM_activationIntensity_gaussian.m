% I=SM_activationIntensity_gaussian(opt)
%
% generate a basal intensity (photons/time unit) for a single fluorophore,
% based on the fields in the opt structure, which is the .baseIntensity
% field in the runinput file. Thismodel returns the same intensity
% opt.itensity every time.
%
% input     : option struct opt, with fields 
%             opt.intensity_mean
%             opt.intensity_std
% output    : I is a Gaussian with mean opt.mean and standard
%             deviation opt.std. Negative intensities are
%             discarded and resampled, so this model is only good if the
%             mean is considerably larger than the standard deviation.
