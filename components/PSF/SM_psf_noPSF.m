% xyDet=SM_psf_noPSF(t,xyzEm,opt)
%
% Dummy PSF function that can be used when movies are not of interest; it
% simply returns the input coordinates.
%
% input:
% t         - photon emision times (one per photon, not used here)
% xyzEM     - positions of photon emitters, one xyz triplet per row for
%             each emitted per photon.
% opt       - PSF options (not used here, but something must be passed).

% output:
% xyDet     - positions of detected photons on the camera chip, randomly
%             generated using the PSF model.
