% function [xyDet,sigma]=SM_psf_lsq1gauss(t,xyzEm,opt)
%
% Simple PSF model for in-plane diffusion, it just adds a zero-mean
% Gaussian noise with a specified standard deviation to every
% x,y-coordinate.
%
% t         - emission times (one per photon, not used here)
% xyzEM     - positions of photon emitters (one per photon), one
%             xyz-triplet per row.
% xyDet     - positions of detected photons on the camera chip, randomly
%             generated using the PSF model.
%
% opt       - PSF options
% opt.sigma - standard deviation of the Gaussian PSF
%
% The options object opt here corresponds to the opt.psf structure defined
% in the Palantir runinput file. Calling the function without input
% arguments returns a default options struct with sigma=130;
