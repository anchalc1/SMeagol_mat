% IMBG=SM_bg_heterogeneous(t,bgOpt,cameraOpt)
% 
% Generate noisy background using Poisson noise with on average
% opt.background.photons_per_pixel(i,j) photons in pixel (i,j), i.e., a
% heterogeneous but time-constant background. EMCCD noise is added
% according to cameraOpt.
%
% input
% t         : Start of frame for which background is to be generated  (not
%             used here). 
% optBG*    : background options struct (opt.background in Palantir).
%             Fields: 
%             optBG.backgroundImage, the name of a mat file containing a
%             matrix that specifies the average number of background
%             photons per pixel. This image needs to be at least as large
%             as the camera ROI specified in the cameraOpt structure, but
%             can be larger (in which case high-index pixels are ignored).
%             Note that 
%               - if an experimentally measured average intensity is used,
%                 it must be converted to units of photons/pixel by
%                 removing any effects of camera offset and gain,
%               - the full path must be specified, and hence this setting
%                 is probably not portable between file systems,
%               - the intensity matrix must be the only variable in the mat
%                 file.
% cameraOpt*: Palantir camera options struct (opt.camera), to pass
%             information about the image size and camera noise parameters.
%             
% * Only needed at first call, or when changing options. Otherwise, old
% values are remembered. 
%
% output
% 1) IMBG   : with no input arguments, a default bgOpt struct is returned.
% 2) IMBG   : with at least the t input parameter, a noisy background image
%             is generated, each pixel count having a Poissin photon
%             distribution with mean value bgOpt.photons_per_pixel, plus the
%             appropriate EMCCD noise and offset.
