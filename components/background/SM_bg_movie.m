% IMBG=SM_bg_movie(t,optBG,cameraOpt)
% 
% A wrapper to use a movie as background, given as a tif stack. If the
% number of simulated frames exceed the number of frames in the background
% movie, the background movie starts over again. Since this is intended for
% use with actual experimental movies, no additional noise is added.
%
% input:
% t       : Start of frame for which background is to be generated  (not
%           used here). 
% optBG*  : background options struct (opt.background in Palantir).
%           Fields: 
% optBG.inputMovie     : path to input image file
%
% cameraOpt*: Palantir camera options struct (opt.camera), to pass
%             information about the image size and camera noise parameters.
%             
% * Only at first call, or when changing options. Otherwise, old values are
% remembered. When passing options, the internal counter is reset, and no
% movie is returned, so that the next call with time only returns the first
% background frame.
%
% output
% 1) IMBG   : with no input arguments, a default optBG struct is returned.
% 2) IMBG   : with at least the t input parameter, the next frame of the
% input movie is returned (independent of the value of t). When the movie
% runs out of frames, it is restarted.
