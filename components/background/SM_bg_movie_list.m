% [IMBG,frame]=SM_bg_movie_list(~,optBG,cameraOpt)
% 
% A wrapper to use a list (cell vector of file names) of movie files as
% background, assuming that the formats match. If the number of simulated
% frames exceed the total number of simulated frames in the previous
% simulation, background movie, the background starts over. No additional
% random background is added, but offset and readout noise must be set to
% zero by hand in order to preserve the background faithfully. 
%
% input:
% t       : Start of frame for which background is to be generated  (not
%           used here). 
% optBG*  : background options struct (opt.background in Palantir).
%           Fields: 
% optBG.movieName : cell vector of path to input image files. To use a
%           previous SMeagol simulation, pass the movieName field of the
%           output structure from SM_getResults.
%
% cameraOpt*: Palantir camera options struct (opt.camera), to pass
%             information about the image size and camera noise parameters.
%             
% * Only at first call, or when changing options. Otherwise, old values are
% remembered. When passing options, the internal counter is reset, and no
% movie is returned, so that the next call with time only returns the first
% background frame.
%
% output
% 1) IMBG   : with no input arguments, a default optBG struct is returned.
% 2) IMBG   : with at least the t input parameter, the next frame of the
% input movie is returned (independent of the value of t). When the movie
% runs out of frames, it is restarted.
