% tActivation=SM_photoActivation_Pa_basal(t0,activation,sample)
% 
% Simulate a single photoactivation event history starting in an inactivated
% state at time t0, given a SM options object SMopt. The output is an
% activation time > t0.
%
% SM_photoActivation_Pa_basal models photo-activation by 1) the activation
% laser, and 2) spontaneous activation, with different rates when the
% illumination laser is on or off. The activated fluorophore starts in
% state sStart=1.
%
% Details:
% 1) A constant activation probability activation.Pa every time the
% activation laser is fired, which occurs every activation.ta. An
% additional random time with exponential distribution and mean value 
% activation.td (can be zero) is added, to enable additional randomness to
% the simulation.
%
% 2) Spontaneous activation with an activation rate activation.ka(I) per
% unit time, with I=1 when illuminated, and I=2 otherwise.
%
% input:
% t0    : time at which the activation process is started. 
% activation : SMeagol activation options (opt.activation). Required fields:
%   t1  : time for first activation laser pulse
%   ta  : time inteval for activation laser, with first pulse at t=t1.
%         ta=inf is an error, the special case of a single activation pulse
%         can be set by setting t1 = pulse time, ta > total simulation
%         time (but finite).
%   Pa  : activation probability every time the activation laser is fired.
%   td  : average delay time for activation  with activation laser.
%         td=0 gives no delay.
% ka=[ka1 ka2] : spontaneous activation rates [with without] illumination
%         laser. 
% sample  : Standard SMeagol sampling options. Used fields:
%           dt  : length of sampling time interval, starting at t=0.
%           tE  : exposure/illumination/aquisition interval. 0 < tE <= dt
%           is required. During each aquisition interval, ka(1) is the
%           activation rate for 0 < t < tE, and the ka(2) is used during tE
%           < t < dt.
%
% output:
% tActivation   : photoactivation time
