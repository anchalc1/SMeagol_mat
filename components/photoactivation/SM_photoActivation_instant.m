% tActivation=SM_photoActivation_Pa_instant(t0,activation,sample)
% 
% Simulate a single photoactivation event history starting in an inactivated
% state at time t0, given some activation and sample options. The output is
% an activation time >= t0. In this case, we use the simple model
% tActivation=t0, no free parameters.
%
% input:
% t0          : time at which the activation process is started. 
% activation  : SMeagol activation options (opt.activation). No required
%               fields. 
% sample      : SMeagol sampling options (opt.sample). No fields used.
%
% output:
% tActivation : photoactvation time
