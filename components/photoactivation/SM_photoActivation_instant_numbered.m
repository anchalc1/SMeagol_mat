% tActivation=SM_photoActivation_instant_numbered(t0,activation,sample)
% 
% Simulate a single photoactivation event history starting in an inactivated
% state at time t0, given some activation and sample options. The output is
% an activation time >= t0. This particular model activates a predetermined
% set of particles (defined through the order in which they are called) to
% tActivation=t0, while other particles are not activated. This is good
% for, e.g., systematically looping through all fluorophores in a big
% simulation.
%
% CAUTION: particle counter is a persistent variable (see matlab help text
% on peristent), and thus it does not reset automatically when a SMeagol
% simulation starts. Calling this function without input arguments will
% reset it, but this must be done manually, or by opening the
% photoactivation parameters dialog in the SMeagol gui.
%
% input:
% t0          : time at which the activation process is started. 
% activation  : SMeagol activation options (opt.activation). 
% activation.pnum = [n1 n2 .. nN]; which particles to activate. Default
%               [1], i.e., activate the first particle.
% sample      : SMeagol sampling options (opt.sample). No fields used.
%
% output:
% tActivation : photoactvation time
