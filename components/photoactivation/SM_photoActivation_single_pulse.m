% tActivation=SM_photoActivation_single_pulse(t0,activation,sample)
% 
% Simulate a photoactivation event history starting in an inactivated state
% at time t0, given a SM options object SMopt. The output is an activation
% time >= t0.
%
% SM_photoActivation_single_pulse models photo-activation by one
% photoactivation event at time tP, where existing fluorophores are
% activated to state sStart=1 with probability Pa, and particles created
% after that are not activated at all. 
%
%
% input:
% t0    : time at which to start the activation simulation.
% activation : SMeagol activation options (opt.activation). Required fields:
%   ta  : time for activation event
%   Pa  : activation probability at the activation event. So, if t0<=ta,
%         then tActivation=ta with probability Pa, and Inf otherwise. If
%         t0>ta, then tActivation=inf (no activation).
% sample  : Standard SMeagol sampling options. Not usewd here.
%
% output:
% tActivation   : photoactivation time
