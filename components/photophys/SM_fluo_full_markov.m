% photophys=SM_fluo_full_markov(opt)
%
% A generator of SMeagol photophysics models from input parameters opt,
% which could be the opt.photophys field of the Palantir runinput options.
%
% In this case, it is a dummy generator that simply returns the appropriate
% fields of the input struct, which is cumbersome to handle explicitly, but
% useful as a template for creatig your own blink&bleach models.
% 
% The input (and output) fields are 
% opt.emissionFactor    relative emission intensity of the illuminated
%                       states. 1*N row-vectors, where N is the number of
%                       photophysical states.
% opt.kb   = {kb1 kb2}; bleaching rates of the states when illuminated (kb1) 
%                       and not illuminated (kb2). N*1 column-vectors,
%                       where N is the number of photophysical states.
% opt.Q    = {Q1   Q2}; Interconversion rate matrices (continuous time)
%                       when illuminated (Q1) and not illuminated (Q2). N*N
%                       matrices. Only off-diagonal elements are used in
%                       the simulations, and normalizations are enforced
%                       elsewhere: Q(i,i)=-sum( Q(i,[1:i-1 i+1:end]);
%
% With no input, the function returns default parameters describing an
% ideal 1-state fluorophore that does not blink or bleach.
%
% To program your own models, make them return the same output fields as
% this function.
