% photophys=SM_fluo_only_bleach(opt)
%
% A generator of Palantir photophysics models from input parameters opt,
% which could be the opt.photophys field of the Palantir runinput options.
%
% In this case, the fluorophore model is one with simple bleaching dynamics
% (no blinking), and the user simpliy specifies the average lifetime of the
% fluorescent state. Bleaching supposedly only takes place during
% illumination, and so this can be used to simulate a simple trade-off
% between long exposure and many images.
% 
% Input: opt struct, with fields
% opt.bleach_time   : mean life-time tB of fluorescent state when the
%                     fluorophore is illuminated. Must be
%                     positive. Default=inf (no bleaching).
% Output: Palantir photophysics opt struct, with fields 
% opt.emissionFactor = 1; (Intensity as specified by the activation model).
% opt.kb      = {1/tB 0}; bleaching only when illuminated.
% opt.Q          = {0 0}; No internal dynamics except bleaching.
%
% With no input, the function returns default parameters describing an
% ideal 1-state fluorophore that does not blink or bleach.
