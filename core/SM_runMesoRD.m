function sysflag=SM_runMesoRD(mesoRDoptions,targetFolder)
% SM_runMesoRD(mesRDoptions,targetFolder)
% Call the mesord binary with a target folder and commandline options
% (including path to a model file) to see if tracking is supported.
% 
% input :
% mesoRDoptions : command-line options for mesoRD. '-h' will print the
%                 mesoRD help text, including a list of options. See also
%                 the mesoRD documentation.
% targetFolder  : folder from which mesoRD is called, which is also where
%                 any output is written. This is done using cd, so
%                 targetFolder can be either absolute or relative to the
%                 current path. Before ending, the current path is reset to
%                 the one from which SM_runMesoRD was called.
%                 default: pwd
% output : The output from mesoRD is written to the matlab command prompt.
% sysflag       : the output from the call to system() that actually
%                 executes the mesoRD command.
